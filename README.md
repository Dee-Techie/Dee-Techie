# 🛡️ My Cybersecurity Portfolio

> "Former IT firefighter — now chasing threats instead of putting out tickets."

## 👋 Hey there! I'm Dee — a former IT Ops lead turning cyber defender.

After 5+ years of firefighting in the world of tech support, systems, and service delivery, I’m pivoting into cybersecurity with purpose (and a bit of caffeine-fueled obsession).

This repo is where I log my progress: hands-on labs, blue team tools, GRC experiments, and battle notes from the front lines of my learning. I'm building toward roles like SOC Analyst, GRC Analyst, or wherever the next alert leads.

Welcome to the messy, curious, and slightly nerdy side of my transition. 💥
