## 👋 Hey there! I'm Dee.

I'm transitioning into cybersecurity and documenting everything I learn along the way. This repo is my digital playground — a living portfolio of labs, policies, write-ups, and tools I’ve built while preparing for roles like SOC Analyst, GRC Analyst, and Blue Team Defender 💥
